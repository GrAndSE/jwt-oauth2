JWT OAuth2
==========

JWT OAuth (rfc7523) implementation provided by extending oauthlib and Django OAuth Toolkit.

The JWT OAuth 2.0 bearer token flow, as defined by RFC 7523, describes how a JWT can be used to request an OAuth access token from a suitably configured provider.

Through jwt_oauth2lib, JWT OAuth2 extends and mirrors the well written and spec compliant OAuthLib package in order provide jwt flow functionality via generic, framework agnostic, utilities.

Through oauth2_jwt_provider, JWT OAuth2 takes advantage of the excellent Django OAuth Toolkit package to ease the way into configuring your OAuth 2.0 provider to accept JWT access token requests.
